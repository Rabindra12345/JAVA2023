hello this is great. this is just a random idea that came in my freaking little mind. And wanted to try it out on chatgpt , and it converted the txt file to pdf format with really really impressive idea and i didnot know about various class like Document , paragraph and sttufs after observing that program i got to know about really really nice stuffs and so here i am trying , i mean basically, copying the idea of chatgpt and writing and trying to test on my IDE to test whether it actually works or not .so let get the shot .


If you feel cold
I can warm you up
If you are sad
I can cheer you up
If you are hungry
We can share an egg cup
But if you need money
Sorry, I have to shut up.
